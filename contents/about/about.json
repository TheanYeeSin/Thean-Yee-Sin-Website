For two years (2017 - 2018), I learned a lot about coding and fell in love with solving problems through technology. After finishing middle school, I decided to study computer science at Asia Pacific University of Innovation and Technology. I was excited to learn more and face new challenges in this field. Pursuing computer science has been an incredible experience that has shaped me and fueled my passion for technology and innovation."
